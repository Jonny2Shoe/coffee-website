        <p>One of the most important things to look at on a coffee bag when you purchase specialty coffee is its processing method. 
            This processing method can inform you as the consumer about what to expect in terms of taste in your cup of coffee. 
            Processing coffee refers to the removal of the fruit surrounding the coffee bean, and processing is a necessary journey the bean must go through before it can be roasted.
            The science of fermentation plays a key role in all methods of coffee processing. It breaks down the mucilage that surrounds the coffee bean, allowing it to be removed. 
            Factors in fermentation, such as temperature, time, sugar, and bacteria present during fermentation, can affect the characteristics of a coffeeâ€™s flavor in various ways. 
            When fermentation is done correctly, it can refine acidity, body, and sugars. If done incorrectly, it can produce negative flavors in the coffee, such as vinegar. 
            We can further dive into the main types of coffee processing seen today: washed, dry, and honey process.
        </p>
        <h4>Washed (Wet)</h4>
        <img src="Processing method pics/washed-coffee-2744214_960_720.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="500" height="300">
        <p>
            In the washed processing method, ripe coffee cherries are picked off the tree, and the outer fruit of the coffee cherry is removed mechanically 
            by a depulper. The beans are then placed into a tank of water for about 24-72 hours, where the mucilage is naturally removed through the 
            fermentation process. The washed beans are now left to dry on raised beds that allow air circulation until they reach a moisture content of about 11%-12%. 
            This processing method results in coffee that highlights the true character of its origin and growing conditions due to its clarity in flavor from the beans' 
            absorption of natural sugars and nutrients. One of the benefits of the washed process is the decreased risk of defects in the resulting beans, but a drawback 
            is that it's generally more expensive due to an increase in water requirements. The flavors of washed coffee tend to be brighter and more acidic, with increased 
            flavor complexity and clarity.
        </p>

        <h4>Dry (Natural)</h4>
        <img src="Processing method pics/natural-coffee-2744210_1280.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="500" height="300">
        <p>
            In the dry processing method, ripe coffee cherries are picked off the trees and spread out on a raised bed to dry in the sun for about 3-6 weeks. During this time, the cherries naturally ferment, and the mucilage and sugars cling to the beans, resulting in the sweetening of the bean. After this, the outer flesh of the fruit is removed by a depulper, and the beans are stored. The dry processing method is considered the most common and traditional method of processing coffee due to its accessibility. The benefits of this method are that it requires fewer resources like water in processing and results in a fruitier and sweeter-tasting coffee. However, it is prone to inconsistencies if the cherries aren't handled properly. The flavors generally found in natural coffees include berries, stone fruit, and various funky flavors.
        </p>

        <h4>Honey (Pulped Natural, Semi-washed, Semi-dry)</h4>
        <img src="Processing method pics/coffee-5020069_960_720.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="500" height="300">
        <p>
            The honey process method is a more scientific and experimental approach, where its name comes from how sticky the coffee beans become during processing. In the honey processed method, ripe coffee cherries are picked from the trees, and the cherries are depulped in a way similar to the washed process. However, the coffee beans are left with a certain amount of mucilage, resulting in the beans being categorized by color as black, red, yellow, or white honey. Black honey has the most mucilage, while white honey has nearly none. The remaining mucilage influences the depth of sweetness and body in the coffee. Similar to other methods, the beans are left to dry on a raised bed before being stored. The pulped natural process is another variation of this method, where only the skin of the coffee cherry is stripped away before drying. The honey processing method results in flavors in the coffee that are somewhere between the natural and washed processes, combining the sweetness and complexity of a natural coffee with the brightness and acidity of a washed coffee.

        <h4>Other Methods</h4>
        <p>
            Coffee processing methods are continually being explored and experimented with beyond just the washed and natural processes. Many new processing methods are being used now, producing exciting flavors that might make you wonder if you're still drinking a cup of coffee.        
        </p>
        <p>Increasingly, you'll find coffees with labels detailing processing methods like Anaerobic Processing, where coffee is processed similarly to washed coffee, but the fermentation is done in sealed tanks, creating an oxygen-free environment. This results in wild and unexpectedly complex flavors in the coffee.
            In certain coffee-growing origins like Indonesia, where the climate doesn't favor beans drying well, the Giling Basah or wet-hulled processing method is used. This is similar to the washed process, but the beans are dried to a higher moisture content percentage of 30-35%, compared to the 11-12% in a washed process. Then, the parchment of the bean is removed and dried once again for storage. This method produces beans that generally have more body and flavor notes of earthiness, mustiness, and tobacco.
        </p>
        <p>Carbonic Maceration is a more experimental and scientifically driven coffee processing method. This is a technique adopted from winemaking where the fruit is fermented in a carbon dioxide-rich environment. Coffee cherries are sealed in steel tanks that are pumped with carbon dioxide, removing all oxygen from the environment where the cherries slowly break down intracellularly (from the inside out). The coffees are kept at a controlled temperature and humidity throughout this process. Flavors from the fruit can't escape the tank and are absorbed into the bean, resulting in the cup having intense and distinct flavors.

        </p>

        <h4>Deciding on a Method</h4>
        <p>
            Coffee producers must decide on which processing method works best for them. They consider factors such as what is profitable and economical with the resources available to them. Factors out of a producer's control, like the climate of where the coffee is grown, impact decisions. For example, a farm in Ethiopia with less access to water may choose to process natural coffee, while a producer in Sumatra with a lot of rainfall and humid conditions may choose to process wet-hulled coffee. Producers want to generate a profit on their crop and gain as much return on their investment as possible, so some may try creating new flavor profiles through experimental processing techniques to add value to their crop and stand out from others.
